# spawn
Template spawning for fish.

## Install
### Fisherman
`fisher knarka/spawn`

### Manually
Copy this repository's functions/spawn.fish to your .config/fish/functions/ folder

## Usage
* `spawn Makefile` copies /home/yourusername/.config/spawn/Makefile to your current directory
* `spawn rm README` copies /home/yourusername/.config/spawn/rm to your current directory as README

Currently, the template folder isn't customizable, but I'm planning on changing that in the future.
